### Statistical Inference
Estimate Average Treatment Effect (ATE): $\hat{\kappa} = Y_{1i} - Y_{0i}$


### RCT
RCTs is hard to do in large group
Divide half of US states randomly and increase taxes 50% in first group ...

### The five methods of Casual Identification
1. Random Assignment
2. Multivariate Regression
3. **IV**
4. Differences-in-difference
5. Regression discontinuity design

#### What is Inference: 
> The process of using data analysis to infer properties of an underlying probability distribution

**In words:** infer properties of an underlying population, using data sampled from that population
- SE
- CI
- Hypothesis testing
- t-stats

### Charateristics of a distribution
Population Mean: $\mu = EY_{i}$
Population variance: $\sigma^2 = E(Y_i - \mu)^2$


#### Mean
- population mean: $\mu_Y = EY_i
- sample mean: $\bar{Y}_n = \frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1} Y_i$

#### SE
> Standard Error gives a sense of how much variation in $\bar{Y}_n$ would arise by chance

SE measures variability in our estimator: $\hat{Y}_n: SE(\bar{Y}_n) = \sqrt{\mathbb{Var}{(\bar{Y}_n)}}$

#### VAR and SE
$$ Var(\bar{Y}_n) = \frac{\sigma_{Y}^2}{n} $$

or 

$$ SE(\bar{Y}_n) = \sqrt{Var(\bar{Y}_n)} = \frac{\sigma_(Y)}{\sqrt{n}} $$

#### Confidence Intervals
- Lower Bound: $\bar{Y}_n - 2 \times SE$
- Upper Bound: $\bar{Y}_n + 2 \times SE$

95% interval: $(\bar{Y}_n - 2SE, \bar{Y}_n + 2SE)$

#### Hypothesis Testing
- we can say we can "reject" any value of $\mu_Y$ outside the confidence interval

#### t-stats
Null Hypothesis: $\mu = \mu^0_{Y}$
Define:
$$
t = \frac{bar{Y}_{n} - \mu^0_{Y}}{\hat{SE}(\bar{Y}_n)}
$$

If we test that $\mu=0$, t-stat becomes ratio of the point estimate to the SE
- IF coefficient is statistically significant (can reject $\mu = 0$)
- Otherwise, we can't reject $\mu = 0$
