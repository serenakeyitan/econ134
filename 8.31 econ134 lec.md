$y_i = ß_0 + ß_1*X_i + ß_i$
- Linear regression is taking averages

### Hypothesis and Null Hypothesis
```
$H_0, ß_1 = 0$
$H_1, ß_1 ≠ 0$ <= common
    $or ß_1 > 0$
    $or ß_1 < 0$
```
    
    
- Size of the test, α, eg α = 0.05 is the probability of commiting Type I error. 
- Rejecting null hypothesis is the inertia. Unless the evidence against a null hypothesis is very strong, we do not reject null hypothesis.

### Randomized Controlled Trial
we do not care about bias in randomized controlled trial since the experiement is truely randomized. 

### Omitted Variable Bias (OVB)
Omitted variable bias occurs when a statistical model fails to include one or more relevant variables. In other words, it means that you left out an important factor in your analysis.
