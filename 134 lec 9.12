#### Regression

$$ In(W_i) = a + bE_i + u_i$$

The two requirements for a good instrument 𝑍𝑖:

1. Correlated with the right-hand side variable (𝐸)

   **“Relevance”**

2. Not systematically correlated with the error term (𝑢𝑖)

   **“Exclusion restriction”**



### $IV$

If the $\mathbb{Cov}(\mathbb{e}_i, x_{ji})$ assumption is violated for OLS. We may be able to avoid bias / identify parameter using $IV$ and 2SLS. 

***For $IV$ to work:***

1. $IV$ needs to be correlated with $x$,
2. $IV$ needs to only affect $y$ via $x$
3. $IV$ cannot affect y and other way

### 2SLS (2-stage least sequence)

***1st stage:*** covariates are regressed against $IV$s to produce a set of fitted values of covariates
***2nd stage:*** the outcome variables is regressed against the fitted covariates

### 2SLS Estimates Operates

$$ y_i = \beta x_{1i} + \beta_2x_{2i} + ... + \beta_jx_{ji} + error_i $$
$$\mathbb{Cov}(error_i, x_{ji}) ≠ 0$$

$IV$: $z_{1i}, z_{2i}$ $for$ $x_{2i}$

$Estimate$ $x_{2i} = \gamma_{0}+ \gamma_1z_{1i} + \gamma_2z_{2i}+ error_i$

To produce fit  $\hat{x}_{2i} = \hat{\gamma}_{0}+ \hat{\gamma}_1z_{1i} + \hat{\gamma}_2z_{2i}$

$\hat{y}_i = \hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta_1}x_{1i} + \hat{\beta_2}x_{2i}$ $or$ $fitted$ $y_i$

${\hat{\beta_{0},}\hat{\beta_{1},}\hat{\beta_2}}$ are 2SLS estimates

### Using multi-instruments

In practice, we often identify one or a couple strong instruments and for the remaining $z_s$, we use the other covariates. eg.
2nd stage: $birthweight$ ~ $\hat{cigs} + motheduc$
1st stage: $cigs$ ~ $cigtax + motheduc$

$birthweight = \beta_0 + \underbrace{ \beta_1cigs + \beta_2motheduc + e_i}_{cov≠0}$

small config interval means small correlation between x and y





recall OLS formula: $$ \hat{\beta^{ols}} = \frac{Cov(Y_i, X_i)}{Var(X_i)} $$

Get IV formula: $$ \hat{\beta^{ols}} = \frac{Cov(Y_i, Z_i)}{Cov(X_i, Z_i)} $$





### Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE)

is the ATE on compliers (a,d)

1. Assigned treatment, receives treatment
2. Assigned treatment, refuses treatment "noncompliers"
3. NOT assigned treatment, receives treatment "defilers"
4. NOT assigned treatment, receives NO treatment



### Limitation of IV

- IV estimates causal effect of E on W only from individuals responsive to random assignment
  - The students at the margin of going to community college 
  - We don’t learn anything from/about students who go to college for sure or 		never go to college

- IV estimates Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) 

- In linear models (typical for macro), causal effect is constant so LATE=ATE. All good.

- IV can fix endogeneity problems COV(X_i, E_i) ≠ 0
  - OVB
  - Reverse Causality Bias
- Find IV that correlates with X not E







#### EXAMPLES OF MACRO SHOCKS 

AS shocks

- Energy prices (Oil)

- Weather
- Supply chain bottlenecks
   (post-COVID disruptions, Japan earthquake)

AD shocks (harder to isolate)

- Government spending
- Taxes
- Monetary policy
- Consumer sentiment / Animal spirit

#### DiD: 

instead of assuming that the two groups are identical (before treatment), make weaker assumption that path of the groups is identical over time

"parallel trend" assumption

### Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE)

In the case of non-compliance, LATE is the ATE on compliers

***Compliers*** 
\begin{cases}
  \text{if assigned treatment, they take treatment}\\    
  \text{if NOT assigned treatment, they do NOT take treatment}\\    
\end{cases}

***Non-Compliers*** \begin{cases}
  \text{A. always takers: receive treatment whether assigned treatment}\\    
  \text{B. never takers: never take treatment even if assigned}\\    
  \text{C. defilers(ignored): always do the opposite of what they are assigned}\\    
\end{cases}

***With Non Compliance, even if we have RCT:***

$z_i$ denotes assignment status

\begin{cases}
  z_i = 1 & \text{if assigned}\\    
  z_i = 0 & \text{if NOT assigned}\\    
\end{cases}


$D_i$ denotes treatment status
\begin{cases}
  D_i = 1 & \text{if assigned}\\    
  D_i = 0 & \text{if NOT assigned}\\    
\end{cases}

#### Solution (one of them) is to use IV

- in RCT, use assignment status as IV to estimate LATE
- In one sided noncompliance, $z_i$ is exogenous, and correlated with outcome through its influence on compliers, and affects outcome through $D_i$

*fitted $\hat{D_i}$ is no longer a binary/dummy variable

#### In the context of RD, use an IV for $D_i$ such that 

$$
y = \beta_0+ \beta_1\hat{D_i} + \beta_2x_i + \epsilon$$
$$

y = \beta_0+ \beta_1\hat{D_i} + \beta_2x_i + \beta_3\hat{D_i}x_i+\epsilon$$

This is a type of ***fuzzy RD*** design

### Difference between Sharp RDD and Fuzzy RDD

- Sharp RDD: Assignment or running variable completely determines treatment. A jump in the probability of treatment before and after cutoff point. 
- Fuzzy RDD: Cutoff point increases the probability of treatment but doesn't completeley determines treatment.

### Chapter 5: Difference-in-Difference (DID)

For treatment group: $△treat = B - A$

Effect of treatment: $DID = △treat - △comp$
